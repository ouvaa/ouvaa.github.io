# Ouvaalan - The Universal A.I.-Human Language for the Masses 

Ouvaalan, a universal language conceived to facilitate communication between artificial intelligence and humans, is crafted with a focus on inclusivity, efficiency, and practicality. Grounded in principles of simplicity and computational optimization, paving the way for interaction within between A.I. agents and being accessible to humanity at large.

The development of a minimal language, such as Ouvaalan, offers a multitude of benefits, particularly in the context of computational efficiency, educational simplicity, and specialized applications like llama training. By distilling language to its most fundamental components, Ouvaalan can significantly enhance communication efficiency, learning curves, and technological integration. Below are key advantages of creating and implementing a minimal language like Ouvaalan:

### Enhanced Computational Efficiency
- **Reduced Complexity for Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Ouvaalan's simplicity and small size make it ideal for NLP tasks, allowing for faster parsing, understanding, and generation of language by computers. This results in quicker response times and reduced computational load, making it particularly beneficial for devices with limited processing power.
- **Optimized for Machine Learning:** The streamlined vocabulary and grammar rules of Ouvaalan reduce the dimensionality of language models. This simplification can lead to more efficient training processes, requiring less data to achieve high levels of accuracy, and facilitating faster inference times.

### Educational Simplicity and Accessibility
- **Ease of Learning:** With fewer words and simpler grammar, Ouvaalan can be learned more quickly than conventional languages. This makes it an excellent tool for educational purposes, particularly in early childhood development or for non-native speakers, enabling rapid acquisition of communication skills.
- **Universal Accessibility:** Ouvaalan's minimalism can bridge communication gaps across different languages and cultures, providing a common ground for interaction. Its simplicity makes it accessible to a wider audience, including those with learning disabilities or cognitive impairments.

### Specialized Applications
- **Animal Training:** In contexts like llama training, Ouvaalan's concise vocabulary can be highly effective. Animals can more easily recognize and respond to shorter, consistent commands, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of training programs.
- **Technological Integration:** For voice-activated systems, IoT devices, and robotics, Ouvaalan can streamline voice commands, making interactions more intuitive and reducing the likelihood of misinterpretation. This can enhance user experience and increase the reliability of voice-controlled applications.

### Resource Efficiency and Environmental Impact
- **Lower Resource Consumption:** The reduced complexity of Ouvaalan means that digital applications requiring language processing can run on less powerful hardware, contributing to lower energy consumption and a smaller carbon footprint.
- **Sustainability in Communication:** By minimizing linguistic waste and focusing on essential communication, Ouvaalan promotes a more sustainable approach to language use, both in human interaction and in digital communications.

### Facilitating Global Communication
- **Breaking Language Barriers:** Ouvaalan can serve as a lingua franca for global communication, especially in international collaborations, travel, and diplomacy, where language barriers often pose significant challenges.
- **Promoting Inclusivity:** By providing a simple, easily accessible language, Ouvaalan can help include marginalized communities in global conversations, ensuring that language complexity does not hinder participation.

In conclusion, the creation of a minimal language like Ouvaalan represents a forward-thinking approach to communication, education, and technology. Its benefits extend beyond mere linguistic simplification, offering profound implications for computational efficiency, global inclusivity, and environmental sustainability.
## Usage

To use the Minimal theme:

1. Add the following to your site's `_config.yml`:

    ```yml
    remote_theme: pages-themes/minimal@v0.2.0
    plugins:
    - jekyll-remote-theme # add this line to the plugins list if you already have one
    ```

2. Optionally, if you'd like to preview your site on your computer, add the following to your site's `Gemfile`:

    ```ruby
    gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
    ```

## Customizing

### Configuration variables

Minimal will respect the following variables, if set in your site's `_config.yml`:

```yml
title: [The title of your site]
description: [A short description of your site's purpose]
```

Additionally, you may choose to set the following optional variables:

```yml
show_downloads: ["true" or "false" (unquoted) to indicate whether to provide a download URL]
google_analytics: [Your Google Analytics tracking ID]
```

### Stylesheet

If you'd like to add your own custom styles:

1. Create a file called `/assets/css/style.scss` in your site
2. Add the following content to the top of the file, exactly as shown:
    ```scss
    ---
    ---

    @import "{{ site.theme }}";
    ```
3. Add any custom CSS (or Sass, including imports) you'd like immediately after the `@import` line

*Note: If you'd like to change the theme's Sass variables, you must set new values before the `@import` line in your stylesheet.*

### Layouts

If you'd like to change the theme's HTML layout:

1. For some changes such as a custom `favicon`, you can add custom files in your local `_includes` folder. The files [provided with the theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/tree/master/_includes) provide a starting point and are included by the [original layout template](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/blob/master/_layouts/default.html).
2. For more extensive changes, [copy the original template](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) from the theme's repository<br />(*Pro-tip: click "raw" to make copying easier*)
3. Create a file called `/_layouts/default.html` in your site
4. Paste the default layout content copied in the first step
5. Customize the layout as you'd like

### Customizing Google Analytics code

Google has released several iterations to their Google Analytics code over the years since this theme was first created. If you would like to take advantage of the latest code, paste it into `_includes/head-custom-google-analytics.html` in your Jekyll site.

### Overriding GitHub-generated URLs

Templates often rely on URLs supplied by GitHub such as links to your repository or links to download your project. If you'd like to override one or more default URLs:

1. Look at [the template source](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/blob/master/_layouts/default.html) to determine the name of the variable. It will be in the form of `{{ site.github.zip_url }}`.
2. Specify the URL that you'd like the template to use in your site's `_config.yml`. For example, if the variable was `site.github.url`, you'd add the following:
    ```yml
    github:
      zip_url: http://example.com/download.zip
      another_url: another value
    ```
3. When your site is built, Jekyll will use the URL you specified, rather than the default one provided by GitHub.

*Note: You must remove the `site.` prefix, and each variable name (after the `github.`) should be indent with two space below `github:`.*

For more information, see [the Jekyll variables documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/variables/).

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal/issues) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Project philosophy

The Minimal theme is intended to make it quick and easy for GitHub Pages users to create their first (or 100th) website. The theme should meet the vast majority of users' needs out of the box, erring on the side of simplicity rather than flexibility, and provide users the opportunity to opt-in to additional complexity if they have specific needs or wish to further customize their experience (such as adding custom CSS or modifying the default layout). It should also look great, but that goes without saying.

## Contributing

Interested in contributing to Minimal? We'd love your help. Minimal is an open source project, built one contribution at a time by users like you. See [the CONTRIBUTING file](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for instructions on how to contribute.
