# Ouvaalan - The Universal A.I.-Human Language for the Masses 

Ouvaalan, a simple, minimalist universal language conceived to facilitate communication between artificial intelligence and humans, is crafted with a focus on inclusivity, efficiency, and practicality. Grounded in principles of simplicity and computational optimization, paving the way for interaction within between A.I. agents and being accessible to humanity at large.

**Ouvaalan** is a portmanteau of **Ouvaa (or waa)**, the universal first word uttered by all new born human beings and **Lan**, which means language in **ouvaalan**.

### Vowels: 
Ouvaalan includes five vowels (A, E, I, O, U), mirroring the basic vowel system found in many world languages. These vowels can appear in short and long forms, which are phonemically distinct and can change the meaning of words.

### Consonants:
With 8 consonants	D, F, H, K, L, N (pronounced as M), S, V (pronounced as W), the consonant system is similarly streamlined, focusing on sounds that are common and easily articulated across languages. It includes a balanced mix of stops, nasals, fricatives, and approximants.

## Ouvaalan Writing System

* **Each letter of the alphabets MUST be represented as a single stroke to complete the letter.** The single stroke lettering enables extremely fast writing. Where capitalization is required, user can reference the image above. 
* Each letters' equivalent are available on modern english based keyboard and thus compatible with existing keyboard systems.

### Base Words:

* **Each base word has a character limit of 5 characters.** Each word is decipherable by spelling and thus eliminate the need for spelling bee competition. This also enables fast reading, writing, pronunciation and comprehension. Including the possibility of using the suffixes "-kh", "ee", and "ae", the total estimated base words can be up to 271,920.
* Each word is primarily chosen for phonetic uniqueness, **primarily based on English** and uses words from all major languages including Mandarin, French, Indonesian, Arabic etc.

However, in actuality, **the base words used will not exceed 2^15 which is 32,768 base words**, the remainder 1 or 2 bits information can be used as "-" to denote continuation or compound of base words so as to represent each base word into a maximum of 2 bytes of data.


## Compound Words

Emphasizing 1 form per word, Ouvaalan has the following features: 
* **No plurals**, examples: 
   - Tree = Tili, Forest = Tili-tili.  
   - Dog = Dok, 2 Dogs = Fa (means 2) Dog, 3 Dogs = Ha (means 3) Dog. Dogs = Dok-dok. 
* **No past, present, future tense**, examples:
    - Today = dodei (do = to, dei = day)
    - Tomorrow = nesdei (nes = next, dei = day)
    - Yesterday = dasdei (das = past, dei = day)
